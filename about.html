            <p>Tom Kupsco is the owner of the two Soccer Edge Stores. He began his career as a CPA working for Grant Thornton.  He then moved on to Dart and Kraft starting in Consolidations and Financial Reporting, but he eventually ended up as manager of Corporate Strategy and Development. During his time at Dart and Kraft, he took night classes at DePaul University to earn his MBA. When Dart and Kraft split up, he was forced to look for a new job and ended up working as a Director of Corporate Marketing at First Chicago Bank.</p>
            <p>Unable to find a job he felt passionate about in the corporate world, he decided it was time to follow his entrepreneurial dream of owning his own business. After seeing an ad in a paper, he opened a Soccer Post retail soccer store as a franchisee. After almost 15 years of operating the stores, he changed the name to The Soccer Edge.</p>
            <p>Tom and his family are located in the Chicago suburbs and all family members have been involved since the store’s opening. Whether it was in the beginning when he and his wife split the store hours and responsibilities or Tom’s oldest daughter who currently manages the store’s Facebook account, Tom and his family have put their heart and soul into this business. Moreover, all of Tom’s employees are from around the area. They range from soccer moms to local high school students who all have indepth knowledge of the retail soccer industry, making this business a premier soccer specialty store.</p>
            <span id="support"><p> Every person involved with the store appreciates your local business support!</p></span>
